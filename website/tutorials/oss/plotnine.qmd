title: Plotnine

## Import and prototype

We'll be using `palmerpenguins` for the dataset,
and `plotnine` to visualize the palmer penguin's `bill_length_mm` column as a histogram.

```{python}
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()
penguins.head()
```

We'll be creating a base histogram using `plotnine` as follows:

```{python}
from plotnine import aes, geom_histogram, ggplot, theme_minimal

g = ggplot(penguins, aes(x="bill_length_mm")) + geom_histogram()
g
```

### Add some layers

Now we want to highlight part of the histogram.
We do this by adding another data and aesthetic layer to our plotnine figure.

```{python}
species = "Adelie" # selected species
selected = penguins.loc[penguins.species == species] # selected data
selected
```

Now that we have the new data, we can add the new selected dataframe to our original figure, `g`

```{python}
g + geom_histogram(data=selected, fill="#447099")
```

### Fix up the histogram

The 2 different `bill_length_mm` are plotted as independent histograms,
so the auto binning is causing the bars to not line up.
Let's re-create our plot and also set a uniform bin width by setting `binwidth=1`.


```{python}
(
    ggplot(aes(x="bill_length_mm"))
    + geom_histogram(penguins, fill="#C2C2C4", binwidth=1)
    + geom_histogram(selected, fill="#447099", binwidth=1)
)
```
