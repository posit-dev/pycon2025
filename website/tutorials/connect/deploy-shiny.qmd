title: "Deploy Shiny App"
order: 10
---

Let's get our application up on the internet.
We'll be using
[Connect Cloud](http://connect.posit.cloud/).

[Connect Cloud](http://connect.posit.cloud/)
provides a cloud environment to
quickly publish, share, and showcase your work --
[it's free for public GitHub repositories](https://connect.posit.cloud/plans)!

::: {.callout-note}
If you want to deploy your application (for free!),
you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account before continuing.
:::

Here's the app we created in the [Shiny Express Lab](/tutorials/shiny/shiny-express.qmd).

::: {.column-page-right}
```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: horizontal
#| viewerHeight: 500

{{< include /tutorials/shiny/includes/app-express.py >}}
```

## Step 0: GitHub account

Before starting make sure you have your github account ready.
You will be creating a repository submitting code into the repo.

You can do this lab completely within the GitHub web interface by
copying code into a new file.

## Step 1: Application `requirements.txt`

When we deploy our application, we need to make sure the packages we use are installed.
Save the below into a `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
shiny
palmerpenguins
plotnine
```

and then install them with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need to have the `requirements.txt` file in the repository so Connect Cloud can create the Python environment.

## Step 2: The application code

Copy the code from our application into a file called `app.py`

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## `app.py`

```{.python}
{{< include /tutorials/shiny/includes/app-express.py >}}
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Connect Cloud

{{< include includes/deploy.qmd >}}

## Step 4: Republish application

{{< include includes/republish.qmd >}}
