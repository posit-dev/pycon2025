## Install and try Positron

If you don't have Positron already, you can download the IDE here:
<https://positron.posit.co/download.html>


### Extensions

Since Positron is built on Code OSS, you can use VS Code extensions in Positron.
Your extensions installed for Positron are separate from the extensions you have installed for VS Code, and they wonâ€™t interfere with each other.
Positron bundles several extensions, including those for Quarto, Jupyter notebooks, and Pyright.
These extensions are installed for you the first time you start Positron.

You can install the
[Shiny Extension from OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/posit/shiny).

## Dashboard

Here's the [Shiny Express Dashboard we've used in this lab](/tutorials/shiny/shiny-express.qmd)

Copy the code below into a file called `app.py`

::: {.callout-caution}
## `app.py`

```{.python}
{{< include /tutorials/shiny/includes/app-express.py >}}
```

If you have the
[Shiny Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/posit/shiny)
installed,
you can click the play button to run the Shiny application.

![](/tutorials/shiny/img/positron-run.png)

Or you can use the Positron Terminal to run your Shiny application

```bash
shiny run --reload app.py
```

This will start the app and open it in your default web browser.

- The `--reload` flag enables automatic reloading. When you save changes to your source files, the app will automatically restart and update in the browser.
- The `--launch-browser` flag opens the app in a browser as soon as it starts.
